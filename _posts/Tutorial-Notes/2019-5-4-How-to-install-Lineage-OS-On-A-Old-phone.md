The main reason and momentum that I want to implement this tutorial is that I can't not tolerant anymore the system that samsung provide (whcih stop updating). It keep shutting down when I am testing my own app and also the main feature of every samsung phone, so hot that can fry a egg on it when you are highly functioning. Although I am not sure if Lineage OS is able to totally solve it, but I do give it a try.</p>
