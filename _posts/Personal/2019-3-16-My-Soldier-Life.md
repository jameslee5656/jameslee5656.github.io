Conscription military service is a civil obligation as a citizen of R.O.C, which I was told since elementary school in civil ethics classes. It is quite distance words from the textbook. However when I apply to finsh my service during summer vacation. It became as real as my life. My service time is fourth months which require me to spend two times of my summer vacation in military facility. When I received the notice from the military service, which list some requires for my service. I had never felt so conflicted in my life. On the one hand, I was kind of excitied to part of the military. On the other hand, I was kind of anxious about what kind of training I would be taught for.<br>
The few point that I would like to share about. In this kind of conscription military service, there wouldn't be really tough and hard tasks that we need to accomplish. It is not a special force training center so it won't be as tough as you watch on TV. However, there still have some requirements that need to be accomplished. Such as, have enough stanina to finish about 3000 meter running in about 15 minutes. Throw a dummy gernade far enough that you won't harm yourself and your robe. I think the most important part of the military is to be disciplined. Do what your chief asked you to do, don't be a smart ass and do something before somebody told you do so. I think this is the main point and if you do accomplish this. It won't be too hard for you to finish this training service.
