<p><span class="image left"><img src="/images/soilder.jpg"></span>Conscription military service is a civil obligation as a citizen of R.O.C, which I was told since elementary school in civil ethics classes. It is far distance words from the textbook. However when I apply to finsh my service during summer vacation. It became as real as my life. My service time require me to spend fourth months which is separated to two times of my summer vacation in military facility. When I received the notice from the military service, listing some requirements for my service. I had never felt so conflicted in my life. On the one hand, I was kind of excitied to be part of the military. On the other hand, I was kind of anxious about what kind of training I would be receive for.

For someone who is looking for some advice about this service. I would be sharing some points about it. To comfort someone who is axious about your oncoming service. Don't panic, it actually won't be too hard for you to finish this training service. In this kind of conscription military service, there wouldn't be really tough and hard tasks that we need to accomplish. It is not a special force training center so it won't be as tough as you watch on TV. However, there still have some requirements that need to be accomplished. Such as, have enough stanina to finish about 3000 meter running in about 15 minutes. Throw a dummy gernade far enough that you won't harm yourself and your robe. I think the most important part of the military is to be disciplined. Do what your chief asked you to do,  don't be a smart ass and do something before somebody told you do so. I think this is the main point which if you do stick to these thing, there won't be to much porblem about it.</p>
